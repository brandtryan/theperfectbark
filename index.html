        <p>My teachers look at me funny when I make weird noises, but my friends, they usually just laugh. It's funny to
          them, and they are pretty cool about it — they don't make fun of me really, but only get a kick out of it —
          like when we are in the middle of a test or something, and then out of nowhere I let out a bark, I mean a loud
          bark, where everyone turns around to me and smiles, and then someone starts laughing, and then everyone else
          gets going. To tell you the truth, it doesn't bother me at all, and I laugh right along with them most of the
          time.</p>
        <p>I go to this school where our teachers are mostly nuns — we have to go to church every week, and sometimes
          I'll bark in church too. This one nun, Sister Agatha, told me that Jesus didn't appreciate mebarking like that
          in church and disruptingeverything. She's mean though — it's funny there's always thatquestion about nuns —
          "is she mean?" — that everyone's always talkin' about — whenever you find out whoyour teachers will be for the
          next year, it's always how mean Sister so and so is, and how this one cuts your hair when you're not looking
          if it grows too long, and how another one will ask you to hold your palmsout so she can smack 'em with a
          ruler. My brother told me all kinds of horrible stuff about every nun I was go—a' have — but with Sister
          Agatha, he wasn't kidding. Yesterday, after telling me all about how Jesus didn't appreciate me disrupting His
          Mass, she smacked me in the back of the head, and told me maybe that will stop me from shaking it.</p>
        <p>I figured though, that Jesus didn't mind so much — since I prayed to Him all the time to help me to
          stopshaking my head, and barking, though it never seemed to help. The way I see it, if He didn't want to
          help,then He probably didn't care too much if I did it in church. Sister Agatha and the rest of the teachers
          told my mom that I was forever disrupting the classes and Masses, and that they were thinking of taking
          further action if I didn't stop, whatever that's supposed to mean. What they were going to do I don't know —
          but my mom thought something was wrong with me anyway, especially after this one time when Icalled my
          basketball coach an asshole right to his face for taking me outta' the game.</p>
